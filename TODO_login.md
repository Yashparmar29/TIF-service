# TODO for Fixing Login Button Functionality

- [x] Modify login.html JavaScript to handle login and registration using localStorage
  - [x] Add functions to store and retrieve users from localStorage
  - [x] Update submit handler for registration: validate inputs, check if email exists, store user data
  - [x] Update submit handler for login: validate email and password against stored users
  - [x] Add success/error messages instead of generic alerts
  - [x] On successful login, redirect to index.html
